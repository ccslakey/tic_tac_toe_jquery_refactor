##Tic Tac Toe jQuery Refactor


####Goal
Refactor the tic tac toe app to use jQuery instead of plain JavaScript.  Either use your existing Tic Tac Toe project, or if you aren't satisfied with your code, you can also work off of the solution provided in the file `ttt-solution.js`.

####Steps
* Note: you do NOT need to fork this repository. We will be updating the same `tic-tac-toe` repo you created for your weekend lab.
* In your local `tic-tac-toe` repo, create a new file called `ttt-jq-refactor.js`.
* Copy your existing tic tac toe `app.js` (or `ttt-solution.js`) into the `ttt-jq-refactor.js` file. This will replace `app.js` in yor new refactored app, so in `index.html`, change the script tag for `app.js` to use `ttt-jq-refactor.js` instead. 
* Include jQuery in your app with another HTML `<script>` tag. Try linking to a CDN.
* In your `ttt-jq-refactor.js`, comment out each section of old JavaScript code and write the corresponding jQuery below it. 
* Test your code as you go!

####Submission
* Add and commit your work in your local repository.
* Push your changes to your gitHub repo.
* Submit the link to your tic-tac-toe github repo (the same link you submitted over the weekend).

####Hints
* Use the [docs](https://api.jquery.com/). They outline the full jQuery API on the front page. Try using <ctrl> + F to search particular keywords. Otherwise, Google should get you what you're looking for.
